# Keyboard Configs For Windows

Eric's Fork of [jeebak/keyboard-windows](https://github.com/jeebak/keyboard-windows).
- Based around [komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi)
  - Configurations split up into multiple includes  

# Original README

An attempt to match my [personal mappings](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/#personal_jeebak) for [Karabiner-Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) under macOS, for Windows.

Instead of using:

- [SharpKeys](https://chocolatey.org/packages/sharpkeys/) to remap CapsLock to control
- [TouchCursor](http://martin-stone.github.io/touchcursor/) for its awesomeness
- [AutoHotKey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/autohotkey.install) for misc. remappings

... use AutoHotKey for all of the above.

Other stuff:

- Old (pre-sierra **only**) [Karabiner](https://github.com/jeebak/dotfiles/tree/6e62207dcaff536edd2913832e5fb6fa3a076986/karabiner) customizations
- For Linux: [touchcursor-x11](https://github.com/jeebak/touchcursor-x11)
- [Example Layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/55f3e3c9149d23cbae5f8ac559627d0f)
